# Databricks Lakehouse Platform Features

## Databricks Workflows
**How it works:** Databricks Workflows is a fully managed orchestration service integrated into the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It allows users to define multi-task workflows (as DAGs of tasks with dependencies) for data processing, analytics, and machine learning pipelines ([Orchestrating Data Analytics on Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/orchestrating-data-analytics-databricks-workflows#:~:text=For%20those%20new%20to%20Databricks%2C,in%20the%20Databricks%20Lakehouse%20Platform)). Workflows can be authored visually in the UI or via APIs/CLI, and tasks can include notebooks, SQL queries, Delta Live Tables pipelines, ML model training, or even other jobs. The service provides built-in scheduling (time-based or event-driven triggers), automated retries, and alerting/monitoring for each step in the workflow ([Databricks Workflow: Managed Orchestration for Lakehouse | element61](https://www.element61.be/en/competence/databricks-workflow-fully-managed-orchestration-service-lakehouse#:~:text=Databricks%20Workflow%20offers%20a%20fully,This%20means)) ([Orchestrating Data Analytics on Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/orchestrating-data-analytics-databricks-workflows#:~:text=match%20at%20L276%20Workflows%20is,their%20workloads%20in%20production%20environments)). This means you can chain tasks (with conditional logic if needed) and manage data pipelines end-to-end without managing any infrastructure.

**Primary use cases:** Common use cases include orchestrating ETL jobs (e.g. ingest raw data, then transform and load into Delta tables), scheduling machine learning training and batch scoring jobs, running streaming pipelines, and automating report generation. For example, a workflow might ingest data to a Bronze table, then trigger a Delta Live Tables pipeline to update Silver/Gold tables, and finally run a Databricks SQL query to refresh a dashboard. Because Workflows supports tasks in any language or tool (SQL, Python, R, etc.), it is used by data engineers, data scientists, and analysts alike to **automate** their respective workloads on a unified platform ([Orchestrating Data Analytics on Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/orchestrating-data-analytics-databricks-workflows#:~:text=For%20those%20new%20to%20Databricks%2C,in%20the%20Databricks%20Lakehouse%20Platform)).

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** As the Lakehouse’s orchestration layer, Workflows ties together various services (data engineering, BI, ML) in production. It ensures reliable, repeatable pipeline execution with enterprise-grade observability (logging, run history, failure notifications) and governance. Since it’s **natively integrated** with Databricks, it can directly leverage other Lakehouse features (like running a DLT pipeline as a task, or using Unity Catalog permissions) and eliminate the need for external schedulers ([Lakehouse Orchestration with Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-orchestration-databricks-workflows#:~:text=who%20choose%20to%20leverage%20the,when%20compared%20to%20the%20alternatives)). This tight integration improves productivity (no context-switching to external tools) and pipeline reliability, making Databricks Workflows the *“glue”* that operationalizes data and AI projects on the Lakehouse.

## Delta Live Tables (DLT)
**How it works:** Delta Live Tables is a **declarative ETL framework** for building reliable, maintainable data pipelines. Instead of writing scheduling code or complex Spark jobs, users define *what* transformations to apply on input data (in SQL or Python), and DLT handles the *how*. Under the hood, it runs on Databricks Runtime and uses Apache Spark’s APIs (including Structured Streaming) to continuously or periodically process data ([What is DLT? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-live-tables/#:~:text=DLT%20is%20a%20declarative%20framework,processing%20between%20transactional%20stores%20like)). DLT manages the orchestration of each table-to-table step, ensuring they execute in the correct order with optimized parallelism and checkpointing. It automatically handles failures with intelligent retries at the finest possible level (down to individual Spark tasks) to maximize reliability ([What is DLT? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-live-tables/#:~:text=,Spark%20and%20Structured%20Streaming%20code)). You can mix batch and streaming sources, and DLT will incrementally process new data and maintain state as needed, so the same pipeline code can handle real-time data feeds or nightly batches.

**Primary use cases:** Delta Live Tables is used to simplify the creation of **medallion architecture** pipelines (Bronze → Silver → Gold tables) with minimal code. For example, you can declare a Bronze table reading raw JSON files, a Silver table that cleanses and joins data, and a Gold table that aggregates results — DLT will figure out the dependencies and continuously update those tables as new data arrives ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=Building%20data%20pipelines%20with%20medallion,architecture)). It’s especially useful for streaming ETL (ingesting from Kafka, cloud storage, etc.) where it can automatically manage offsets and incremental processing. DLT also has built-in data quality controls called **expectations**: you can declare rules on a dataset (e.g. “no nulls in this column”), and DLT will track or even drop records that violate them ([Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables - Azure Databricks ...](https://learn.microsoft.com/el-gr/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations#:~:text=Manage%20data%20quality%20with%20Delta,An)). This ensures **data quality** is maintained at each stage of the pipeline. In summary, the primary use case is to accelerate building **incremental data pipelines** (both streaming and batch) without needing to write complex Spark job code or manual orchestration.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Delta Live Tables greatly simplifies **data engineering** on the Lakehouse. By abstracting away error-prone aspects (like job scheduling, checkpointing, recovery, and performance tuning), it allows engineers to focus on business logic. It contributes reliability (with automatic retries and quality checks) and maintainability (pipelines are declared in a modular way). DLT is also tightly integrated with other Lakehouse components: it produces Delta Lake tables (with ACID reliability), works with Unity Catalog for governance, and can be scheduled via Databricks Workflows or triggered from notebooks. Overall, DLT helps ensure that the data in Bronze/Silver/Gold layers is always up-to-date and trustworthy, reinforcing the Lakehouse principle of a single platform for all data from streaming ingest to analytics.

## Medallion Data Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers)
The medallion architecture is a data design pattern that organizes data in **three logical layers** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to progressively improve its structure and quality ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=A%20medallion%20architecture%20is%20a,hop%22%20architectures)). Databricks endorses this architecture as a best practice for implementing a Lakehouse, often in conjunction with Delta Lake and DLT. Each tier has a specific role:

- **Bronze Layer (Raw data):** The Bronze tier contains *raw ingested data* from various sources, stored in its original form (``as-is`` schema) along with metadata like ingestion timestamps ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=The%20Bronze%20layer%20is%20where,data%20from%20the%20source%20system)). This layer acts as the landing zone and audit log of the data – it retains **all the original data (including duplicates or errors)** and enables reprocessing or backfills if needed. Bronze tables are typically append-only and capture Change Data Capture feeds or incremental appends from operational systems. The focus here is on ingesting data quickly and durably, not on analytics yet ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=The%20Bronze%20layer%20is%20where,data%20from%20the%20source%20system)).

- **Silver Layer (Cleansed & conformed data):** The Silver tier takes Bronze data and **cleans, deduplicates, and merges** it into a more refined form ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=In%20the%20Silver%20layer%20of,reference%20tables)). Here data from disparate sources is harmonized (e.g., conforming date formats, joining reference data, handling missing values) to create an **enterprise-wide view** of key entities (customers, products, transactions, etc.) ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=In%20the%20Silver%20layer%20of,reference%20tables)). Light transformations are applied to improve data quality while keeping it general-purpose. The Silver layer enables self-service analytics and is often in a relational format suitable for broad consumption by analysts and data scientists. It serves as the source for building Gold tables, and because it’s cleansed and unified, it dramatically simplifies those downstream efforts ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=The%20Silver%20layer%20brings%20the,projects%20in%20the%20Gold%20Layer)).

- **Gold Layer (Curated feature/aggregated data):** The Gold tier consists of **business-level tables** that are highly refined for specific analytics or application use cases ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=Data%20in%20the%20Gold%20layer,Gold%20Layer%20of%20the%20lakehouse)). This is where further transformations such as aggregations, calculations, and denormalizations occur to create **ready-to-use data for reporting or machine learning**. Gold tables are often organized in a star-schema or other denormalized models for performance (e.g., fact and dimension tables for BI, or feature tables for ML). Examples include a table of daily sales by store (for dashboards), or a feature table of customer purchase frequency (for input to ML models). The Gold layer represents the **single source of truth** for enterprise KPIs and domain-specific datasets – the data here is clean, aggregated or enriched, and optimized for consumption ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=Data%20in%20the%20Gold%20layer,Gold%20Layer%20of%20the%20lakehouse)).

**How it contributes:** The medallion architecture provides a **clear pathway for data evolution** in the Lakehouse: data reliability and quality improve as data flows from Bronze to Silver to Gold ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=A%20medallion%20architecture%20is%20a,hop%22%20architectures)). This enables a modular approach to data engineering – each layer can be independently developed and optimized. It also aligns with different user groups: for example, data engineers focus on Bronze/Silver (data preparation), whereas analysts and data scientists consume Silver/Gold for insights. In Databricks, this architecture is naturally supported by Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables: Bronze and Silver tables often use Delta Lake’s ACID features to manage incremental updates, and DLT can automate creation of Bronze→Silver→Gold pipelines ([What is a Medallion Architecture?](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture#:~:text=Building%20data%20pipelines%20with%20medallion,architecture)). By adopting the medallion design, organizations ensure **data quality control** at each stage (you only promote data to Silver/Gold after it meets criteria), and they retain the raw data for traceability. This multi-hop architecture is fundamental to a Lakehouse implementation because it blends the best of data lakes (all raw data stored cheaply) with data warehouses (curated, high-quality data for analytics).

## Databricks Machine Learning (Databricks ML)
**How it works:** Databricks Machine Learning is an integrated end-to-end environment for developing, tracking, and deploying machine learning models on the Lakehouse. It includes a specialized “ML” workspace in Databricks with tools and UI tailored for ML projects. Under the hood, Databricks ML provides managed services for the entire ML lifecycle: experiment tracking, model training and tuning, feature engineering, and model publishing/serving ([4 Key Features of Databricks Machine Learning](https://key2consulting.com/4-key-features-databricks-machine-learning/#:~:text=According%20to%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20official%20documentation%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%282)). When using Databricks ML, data scientists can leverage interactive **notebooks** or IDE integrations to explore data and build models using popular libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.), all running on scalable clusters (including GPU support) pre-configured with the Databricks **ML Runtime** (which comes with many ML/DL libraries).

Important built-in components include:
- **Managed MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registry: Every run (training experiment) can automatically log metrics, parameters, and model artifacts to MLflow. The **Model Registry** allows registering a model version, reviewing it, and moving it through stages (Staging/Production) with approval workflows.
- **Databricks Feature Store** for feature management: This lets you create and share reusable features across models. During training, features can be logged, and later those same feature values can be served for online predictions, ensuring consistency between training and inference.
- **AutoML** integration for rapid prototyping (see *Databricks AutoML* below): This can generate baseline models and notebooks for a given dataset with minimal user input.
- **Model Serving** capabilities: Databricks provides options to deploy models as REST endpoints (serverless model serving) or export them for inference. Models in the registry can be deployed with one click to a secure endpoint that auto-scales, allowing real-time predictions.

**Primary use cases:** Databricks ML is used by data science teams to **collaboratively build and deploy ML models**. Common use cases include training models on large-scale data (leveraging Spark for distributed data processing or Horovod for distributed deep learning), hyperparameter tuning experiments (which can be managed via MLflow), and tracking numerous experiments in an organized way. Because it’s built on the Lakehouse, data scientists can easily access the Silver/Gold layer data for features and then save model predictions or metrics back to Delta tables. Another key use case is **model lifecycle management** – e.g., a team can register the best model from experiments in the Model Registry and serve it to production, while automatically capturing lineage (which data and code produced that model) for compliance. Overall, Databricks ML caters to anything from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to building production-grade pipelines (using Jobs/Workflows to retrain models on schedule) in one unified workspace.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Databricks Machine Learning brings **AI/ML workloads as a first-class citizen** to the Lakehouse Platform. It bridges the gap between data engineering and data science: all data (including features) and models are governed under the same Unity Catalog governance, and experiments are conducted on the same platform that houses the data, which eliminates silos. By providing managed infrastructure for tracking and serving models, it greatly accelerates the deployment of ML use cases. For example, experiment tracking and model registry (via MLflow) ensure **reproducibility and governance** of models across their lifecycle ([4 Key Features of Databricks Machine Learning](https://key2consulting.com/4-key-features-databricks-machine-learning/#:~:text=According%20to%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20official%20documentation%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%282)). Integration with the Feature Store and Delta Lake means feature values and training data versions are consistent and reproducible, reinforcing the reliability of ML outputs. In short, Databricks ML turns the Lakehouse into a one-stop shop for data and ML, enabling organizations to not only analyze data but also to continuously **learn from it and build AI applications** on top of it.

## Databricks SQL
**How it works:** Databricks SQL provides a **data warehousing and BI** experience directly on the Lakehouse. It offers an intuitive SQL editor interface where data analysts and engineers can write ANSI SQL queries against data in Delta Lake (or other data sources), explore schemas, and create visualizations. Results can be assembled into rich **dashboards** with charts and scheduled refreshes ([Get started with data warehousing using Databricks SQL | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/get-started#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20data%20analyst,can%20help%20you%20get%20started)). Behind the scenes, Databricks SQL uses specialized compute clusters called **SQL Warehouses** to execute queries. These warehouses can be multi-cluster endpoints that auto-scale for concurrent use, and they can run in a serverless mode (fully managed by Databricks for instant startup and scaling). Databricks SQL is powered by the **Photon engine**, a native vectorized execution engine that dramatically speeds up SQL query processing. By default, all queries use Photon for high-performance, especially on analytical queries, giving up to *12x better price/performance* compared to traditional cloud data warehouses ([Databricks SQL Demo Video | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/resources/demos/videos/data-warehouse/databricks-sql#:~:text=What%20you%E2%80%99ll%20learn)) ([Orchestrating Data Analytics on Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/orchestrating-data-analytics-databricks-workflows#:~:text=Dashboards%20consolidate%20multiple%20visualizations%2C%20creating,and%20unstructured%20data%2C%20machine%20learning)).

**Primary use cases:** This component is geared towards **analytics and business intelligence**. Use cases include interactive querying of datasets (ad-hoc analysis), building and sharing dashboards for metrics (e.g., weekly sales dashboards, operational reports), and supporting external BI tools. Via **ODBC/JDBC** endpoints, Databricks SQL allows tools like PowerBI, Tableau, Looker, or custom applications to query lakehouse data as if it were a traditional database. With support for features like query result caching, query scheduling, and alerts on query outcomes, it covers the key functionalities of a cloud data warehouse. Another use case is data exploration and experimentation by data scientists who prefer SQL – they can quickly inspect data or create summary tables using the SQL UI. Because Databricks SQL provides **concurrency and fast performance** on Delta tables, it enables the Lakehouse to satisfy BI workloads that normally would be on a separate data warehouse. 

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Databricks SQL fulfills the **“analytics/BI” role of the Lakehouse**, enabling analysts to work directly on the single source of truth (the Delta Lake tables) instead of needing data copied to a separate warehouse. This tightens the feedback loop – as soon as data is in Bronze/Silver/Gold, it’s immediately available for analysis with no extra ETL. With the high-performance Photon engine and auto-scaling warehouses, Databricks SQL ensures that even large or complex queries run efficiently on lakehouse data ([Orchestrating Data Analytics on Databricks | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/orchestrating-data-analytics-databricks-workflows#:~:text=Dashboards%20consolidate%20multiple%20visualizations%2C%20creating,and%20unstructured%20data%2C%20machine%20learning)). It also integrates with Unity Catalog for access control, so governance policies apply uniformly to SQL users. In essence, Databricks SQL brings **warehouse-style performance and ease-of-use to the data lake**, completing the Lakehouse vision of a unified platform for all data workloads (streaming, data science, and BI). By doing so, it enables teams to build reports and dashboards on the freshest data, co-located with advanced AI/ML, which improves data-driven decision making across the organization.

## Apache Spark Structured Streaming
**How it works:** Structured Streaming is the core streaming engine of Apache Spark, and Databricks leverages it to provide **near-real-time stream processing** on the Lakehouse. It treats streaming data as an unbounded table that is being continuously appended to, and allows you to write queries against it using the same Spark SQL/DataFrame API as batch queries ([Structured Streaming concepts | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/structured-streaming/concepts#:~:text=Apache%20Spark%20Structured%20Streaming%20is,result%20as%20streaming%20data%20arrives)). The engine then automatically runs your query logic in small incremental batches (or micro-batches) or continuous processing mode, and updates the result as new data arrives. Structured Streaming guarantees **end-to-end exactly-once processing** (with supported sinks like Delta) and fault tolerance: it tracks offsets and progress in checkpoint files so that if a failure occurs, it can resume without data loss or duplication ([Structured Streaming concepts | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/structured-streaming/concepts#:~:text=Apache%20Spark%20Structured%20Streaming%20is,result%20as%20streaming%20data%20arrives)). Developers can focus on the transformations (e.g., parsing, filtering, aggregating events) while Spark handles streaming under the hood (managing timers, state, and recovery). In Databricks, Structured Streaming is deeply integrated – for example, reading from a cloud storage directory will automatically tail new files, or reading from Kafka will subscribe and ingest continuously.

**Primary use cases:** This engine powers **streaming ETL and real-time analytics** in the Databricks platform. Typical use cases include ingesting streams of data from sources like Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Azure Event Hub, or files landing in cloud storage, and writing results to Delta Lake tables or other sinks in a continuous fashion ([Structured Streaming concepts | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/structured-streaming/concepts#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20Structured%20Streaming,data%20sources%20include%20the%20following)). For instance, a company might stream website clickstream data into a Bronze table and use Structured Streaming to join it with reference data and update a Silver table of cleaned events in real-time. Another use case is real-time dashboards and alerting: Structured Streaming can aggregate metrics in sliding windows (e.g., count errors in the last 5 minutes) and the results can be pushed to Gold tables or in-memory, which Databricks SQL or an external dashboard can query with minimal lag. It’s also used for **event-driven applications**, such as detecting anomalies (and then triggering a Workflow job or notification) or feeding machine learning models for inference on streaming data. Essentially, any scenario requiring processing of data as it arrives (instead of waiting for batches) is a fit for Structured Streaming – and because the same code can run in batch or streaming mode, it offers a seamless path from development to production.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Structured Streaming is fundamental in making the Lakehouse capable of handling **real-time data alongside batch data**. Its integration means that Delta Lake tables can be used as both streaming sources and sinks, allowing a *single copy of data* to serve dual purposes – streaming applications and historical batch analysis – with ACID guarantees ([What is Delta Lake? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/#:~:text=log%20for%20ACID%20transactions%20and,and%20providing%20incremental%20processing%20at)). This unifies architectures (no separate Lambda architecture needed). Moreover, Structured Streaming’s exactly-once guarantee with Delta Lake ensures data integrity in pipelines (no duplicate records even if jobs restart), which is crucial for trust in real-time analytics. By supporting both streaming ingestion and consumption, Databricks can power complex continuous pipelines (for example, feeding real-time predictions into dashboards while also storing those predictions for offline analysis). In summary, Structured Streaming adds the **“speed layer”** to the Lakehouse Platform, enabling use cases like real-time fraud detection, IoT sensor analytics, and live customer analytics to run on the same reliable data platform as your batch jobs ([Structured Streaming concepts | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/structured-streaming/concepts#:~:text=Apache%20Spark%20Structured%20Streaming%20is,result%20as%20streaming%20data%20arrives)).

## Databricks AutoML
**How it works:** Databricks AutoML is an automated machine learning tool that accelerates the model development process by generating baseline models and notebooks automatically. With AutoML, a user simply provides a dataset and selects the prediction target and ML task type (classification, regression, or forecasting). The AutoML system then performs an automated training pipeline: it will do things like split the data into training/validation/test sets, apply basic preprocessing (e.g., impute missing values, normalize features), and train multiple candidate models using a variety of algorithms and hyperparameter combinations. Under the hood, it leverages common ML libraries (such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Prophet for time-series, etc.) and optimizes hyperparameters using techniques like random search or Bayesian optimization. Crucially, Databricks AutoML follows a **“glass box”** approach – for each trial run and for the final model, it **generates notebooks** with the training code and detailed results ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Databricks%20AutoML%20allows%20you%20to,code%20approach)). This means you can inspect exactly what it did, customize the code further, or use it as a starting point for your own development.

**Primary use cases:** The primary use case for AutoML is to **jump-start ML projects** and rapidly create baseline models. It’s useful for both beginners and experienced data scientists: beginners (or “citizen data scientists”) can obtain a reasonable model without extensive ML expertise, and experts can save time by having AutoML do the heavy lifting of trying many algorithms/parameters, then take over with the provided notebook ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Databricks%20AutoML%20allows%20you%20to,code%20approach)). For example, if tasked with predicting customer churn, an analyst could use AutoML to train and evaluate dozens of models and get a ranked leaderboard of model performances, plus notebooks showing how each model was trained. This drastically reduces the time to get initial results. Another use case is model selection – AutoML can help identify which algorithms are worth further tuning for a given dataset (maybe it finds that XGBoost outperforms neural networks for your data). It also ensures good practices out-of-the-box: every AutoML experiment uses **MLflow** to log metrics, uses proper train/validation splits, and performs hyperparameter tuning, so the resulting model is not just a quick guess but fairly well-optimized ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Automate%20the%20grind%20of%20machine,learning)). In scenarios like time-series forecasting, AutoML can automatically try different forecasting models and even make holiday effect adjustments, which would save significant effort.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Databricks AutoML contributes by making machine learning on the Lakehouse more **accessible and efficient**. It empowers a wider range of users to participate in model development (since you don’t have to hand-code everything), which is aligned with the Lakehouse philosophy of unifying data teams. By producing notebooks with standard code, it also serves as an educational tool – teams can learn from the best practices encoded in those notebooks (feature normalization, proper splitting, etc. ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Automate%20the%20grind%20of%20machine,learning))). Moreover, because AutoML is integrated with other Databricks services, the models it produces are immediately ready to be managed in the ML lifecycle: all experiments are tracked in MLflow and the best model can be registered to the Model Registry with one click. This tight integration means faster **cycle from data to insight** – one could ingest data into Bronze/Silver, use AutoML to quickly get a model on that data, and then deploy that model using Databricks Model Serving, all within the same platform. In essence, AutoML amplifies the productivity of the Lakehouse for ML tasks by automating the grunt work and ensuring that even baseline models follow best practices, leading to more reliable and reproducible ML outcomes ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Databricks%20AutoML%20allows%20you%20to,code%20approach)) ([Databricks AutoML - Automated Machine Learning | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/automl#:~:text=Automate%20the%20grind%20of%20machine,learning)).

## Unity Catalog
**How it works:** Unity Catalog is Databricks’ unified **data governance and catalog** service for the Lakehouse. It provides a central metadata store and access control layer for all data assets (tables, files) as well as ML assets (models, etc.) in Databricks, across all cloud platforms ([Databricks Unity Catalog: Data Governance | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog#:~:text=Databricks%20Unity%20Catalog%20is%20the,unified%20and%20open%20approach%20to)). Unity Catalog introduces the concept of a three-level namespace (metastore 🡆 catalog 🡆 schema 🡆 table) that lets organizations organize data by logical categories. Administrators can define finely-grained **permission policies** (down to the table, view, column level) and share data securely between different Databricks workspaces or even external platforms. UC also automatically **captures data lineage**: as jobs run, it records which tables were read and written, allowing users to trace the provenance of data down to the column level. Additionally, Unity Catalog serves as a **data discovery catalog** – users can search for data assets in one place, see descriptions, tags, and usage metrics, which fosters easier collaboration and reuse of data.

**Primary use cases:** The primary use case of Unity Catalog is to implement **enterprise-grade data governance** on the Lakehouse. For example, a company can set up a Unity Catalog metastore that all their Databricks workspaces use, and define that only the Finance team’s group can **SELECT** from the “Finance” schema in Silver, or that personal data columns are masked unless you have specific permissions. This simplifies compliance with regulations like GDPR/HIPAA by centrally controlling access to sensitive data. Another use case is **data lineage and auditing**: if an analyst finds an issue in a Gold table, they can use Unity Catalog’s lineage to identify which Silver table and upstream notebooks contributed to it, aiding debugging and impact analy ([Data Lineage With Unity Catalog - Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/resources/demos/tutorials/governance/data-lineage-with-unity-catalog#:~:text=Data%20Lineage%20With%20Unity%20Catalog,your%20lakehouse%20on%20any%20cloud)) ([Databricks Unity Catalog: Data Governance | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog#:~:text=With%20Unity%20Catalog%2C%20organizations%20can,unified%20and%20open%20approach%20to))04】. Data discovery is also enhanced – data engineers can annotate tables and track schema versions, and data consumers can easily find what data is available and trustworthy (for instance, search “customer_churn” to find the curated churn dataset and see it’s certified by the data team). Furthermore, Unity Catalog supports **Delta Sharing** (see below), meaning it can govern not just internal access, but also what data is shared outside the organization. In summary, any scenario requiring controlled, audited, and discoverable data access in Databricks is a fit for Unity Catalog.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Unity Catalog is a **foundational component for security and governance** in the Lakehouse Platform. By providing a *unified governance layer* for all data and AI assets, it ensures that the Lakehouse can be adopted as an enterprise-wide platform (since large organizations require robust security & auditi ([Databricks Unity Catalog: Data Governance | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog#:~:text=Databricks%20Unity%20Catalog%20is%20the,unified%20and%20open%20approach%20to))04】. It brings the **“single source of truth”** for metadata and permissions, replacing ad-hoc solutions (like scattered Hive metastores or file-based ACLs) with a coherent model. This greatly simplifies managing permissions as data teams and use cases scale. Moreover, because Unity Catalog also governs ML models, notebooks, and dashboards, it aligns with the Lakehouse’s aim to handle not just data but AI assets: e.g., you can restrict who can invoke a production ML model or see a particular dashboard, all through the same interface. In terms of compliance and collaboration, Unity Catalog accelerates projects by enabling safe data sharing – teams get access to the data they need without lengthy IT processes, and all usage is **auditable**. By enforcing governance **consistently across clouds** and workspaces, Unity Catalog truly centralizes governance in a multi-cloud Lakehouse deploym ([Databricks Unity Catalog: Data Governance | Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog#:~:text=With%20Unity%20Catalog%2C%20organizations%20can,unified%20and%20open%20approach%20to))04】. Ultimately, Unity Catalog ensures the Lakehouse has enterprise-grade trust and security, which is key to making a unified platform viable for all of an organization’s data, analytics, and AI needs.

## Delta Lake
**How it works:** Delta Lake is the **open-source storage layer** that underpins Databricks’ Lakehouse, bringing reliability and performance to data lakes. Technically, Delta Lake extends Apache Parquet files with a **transaction log** (`_delta_log`), which records every data change (adds, updates, deletes) to a ta ([What is Delta Lake? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/#:~:text=Delta%20Lake%20is%20the%20optimized,providing%20incremental%20processing%20at%20scale))43】. When you write data to a Delta table, it’s treated as an ACID transaction – Delta Lake will generate a new transaction log entry (and new Parquet file segments if data was added) and atomically commit it, ensuring **atomicity** and **consistency** (readers either see the entire commit or not at a ([What is Delta Lake? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/#:~:text=Delta%20Lake%20is%20the%20optimized,providing%20incremental%20processing%20at%20scale))43】. It leverages optimistic concurrency control to handle simultaneous writes, preventing conflicts. This design allows powerful features: **time travel** (you can query a table at a previous point in time by referencing an old snapshot in the log), **rollback** (easy to revert to a previous version if something went wrong), and **schema enforcement** (it can block writes that don’t match the expected schema, or allow controlled schema evolution with tracking of schema chang ([Delta Tables 101: A Comprehensive Overview (2025) - Chaos Genius](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/delta-table/#:~:text=Genius%20www,tasks%20and%20enable%20advanced%20analytics))26】. Delta’s transaction log also maintains file-level statistics (like min/max values) to speed up reads via data skipping. Reading from a Delta table means the engine reads the log to understand which Parquet files are current, so query engines only scan the latest valid data. In Databricks, Delta Lake is deeply integrated: all reads/writes by default go through Delta, and features like Structured Streaming are optimized to work with it for incremental reads/writes.

**Primary use cases:** Delta Lake’s primary use case is to provide a **single store for all analytics data with reliability**. This includes storing raw data (Bronze), cleaned data (Silver), and aggregate data (Gold) all as Delta tables, so that data engineers can incrementally update them and **avoid data corruption or partial writes**. A common use case is **MERGE (upserts)**: Delta Lake allows merging changes (like UPSERTs and DELETES) into large fact tables, which is hard to do on plain data lakes. This makes it ideal for change data capture pipelines, or whenever you need to regularly update records (e.g., correct erroneous data or apply late-arriving updates) – tasks that traditionally required a data warehouse. Another use case is **auditing and reproducibility** – thanks to time travel, analysts can reproduce a report as of last week by querying a table “as of” that date, or recover data that might have been accidentally dele ([Delta Tables 101: A Comprehensive Overview (2025) - Chaos Genius](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/delta-table/#:~:text=Genius%20www,tasks%20and%20enable%20advanced%20analytics))26】. Large-scale ETL is also easier: if a job writes a partition and fails halfway, Delta’s ACID guarantees mean readers won’t see half-written data, and the job can be retried safely. Additionally, Delta Lake supports **batch and streaming** uniformly; for example, a Structured Streaming job can continually write to a Delta table while another batch job reads from it without issue. In summary, anyone needing a **reliable, scalable data lake** (with features akin to a database) uses Delta Lake – it’s the default for storing tables in Databricks for everything from logs, IoT data, to feature tables for ML.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Delta Lake is *the backbone of the Lakehouse*. It marries the scalability and flexibility of a data lake with the **transactional reliability** of a data wareho ([What is Delta Lake? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/#:~:text=Delta%20Lake%20is%20the%20optimized,providing%20incremental%20processing%20at%20scale))43】. By doing so, it eliminates the historical gap where data lakes were fast for dumping data but unreliable for complex reads/updates. In the Lakehouse architecture, Delta Lake enables the same data to be used for streaming and batch processing seamles ([What is Delta Lake? | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/#:~:text=log%20for%20ACID%20transactions%20and,and%20providing%20incremental%20processing%20at))41】, which simplifies system architecture (no separate systems for real-time vs batch analytics). Its open format and transaction log also encourage an **open ecosystem** – many other tools (Spark, Presto/Trino, Hive, Flink, etc.) can read Delta Lake or implement the Delta protocol, avoiding vendor lock-in. All of Databricks’ higher-level features (like DLT, Workflows, ML) rely on Delta’s guarantees to function correctly: for example, ACID ensures that if an ML training job is reading a table while an ETL pipeline writes to it, the model sees a consistent snapshot. Delta’s schema evolution and auditing features build trust in the data by preventing bad data writes and enabling traceability. In short, Delta Lake provides the **“Lakehouse” with warehousing features** – ACID transactions, time travel, schema managem ([Delta Tables 101: A Comprehensive Overview (2025) - Chaos Genius](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/delta-table/#:~:text=Genius%20www,tasks%20and%20enable%20advanced%20analytics))26】 – on inexpensive cloud storage. This drastically improves data quality and manageability in the Lakehouse, making it feasible to have a single data repository for all purposes.

## Lakehouse AI
**How it works:** Lakehouse AI is a collection of new capabilities and optimizations in Databricks aimed at enabling and accelerating **AI, especially generative AI (GenAI), on the Lakehouse**. Announced in 2023, Lakehouse AI builds on Databricks Machine Learning to support the unique needs of training and serving large AI models (like large language models, LLMs) using the data in the Lakehouse. A key principle of Lakehouse AI is a **“data-centric” approach to AI development** – leverage the high-quality, governed data in the Lakehouse as the fuel to train or fine-tune models, rather than exclusively focusing on model architectu ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20will%20have%20a,innovations%20include%20Vector%20Search%2C%20Lakehouse))11】. 

Some notable features introduced under Lakehouse AI include:
- **Vector Search**: The ability to index and query vector embeddings stored in the Lakehouse. This is crucial for applications like semantic search or retrieval augmented generation with LLMs. Databricks added efficient vector indexing and similarity search capabilities so that LLM applications can store embeddings (from text, images, etc.) in Delta tables and query them with low late ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Lakehouse%20AI%20and%20its%20unique,5%2C%20and%20more))13】.
- **Lakehouse Monitoring**: Advanced monitoring for ML models, including drift detection and data quality monitoring in production (e.g., observing if input data distributions change). This helps maintain AI solutions by using the Lakehouse to log predictions and outcomes, and automatically tracking metrics over t ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Lakehouse%20AI%20and%20its%20unique,5%2C%20and%20more))13】.
- **GPU-accelerated Model Serving**: Optimizations for serving large models (like LLMs or other deep learning models) with GPUs in a serverless manner. This includes support for serving PyTorch/TensorFlow models with high throughput and the ability to scale GPU clusters on demand, so AI applications can be deployed directly from the Lakehouse without external infrastruct ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Lakehouse%20AI%20and%20its%20unique,5%2C%20and%20more))13】.
- **Model Governance and MLflow 2.x enhancements**: Improvements to MLflow and Unity Catalog integration to handle AI models (including chain-of-thought prompts or other artifacts). For example, MLflow 2.5+ introduced better support for managing models with many artifacts (as large models ha ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Lakehouse%20AI%20and%20its%20unique,5%2C%20and%20more))13】. There’s also **MosaicML integration** (Databricks acquired MosaicML, a company focused on efficient AI training) – which is now reflected in features like the **MosaicML training platform** integrated into Databricks, enabling users to train or fine-tune big models on Databricks with optimized algorithms (e.g., faster distributed training).
- **AI Gateway and Tools**: Databricks introduced an AI Gateway for managing access to third-party model APIs and an **AI Functions** library to easily call open-source or external models. Additionally, an **AI Playground** was provided for trying prompts against various LLMs in the UI. These tools aim to make it easier to compare and integrate large models into Lakehouse workfl ([AI and machine learning on Databricks | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/machine-learning/#:~:text=,See%20%2019%20External%20models)) ([AI and machine learning on Databricks | Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/machine-learning/#:~:text=,performance%20for%20your%20specific%20application))70】.

**Primary use cases:** Lakehouse AI is geared towards organizations that want to develop **advanced AI applications (like generative AI, LLM-based apps) using their own data**. Use cases include fine-tuning a large language model on proprietary text data to create a custom chatbot, building a semantic search engine over enterprise documents, running real-time recommendation engines using vector similarity search, and monitoring deployed AI models for bias or drift. Essentially, it streamlines tasks like embedding generation and retrieval (for example, storing document embeddings in a Delta table and querying them via vector search to feed into an LLM for answer generation). Another use case is **LLMOps** – managing the lifecycle of LLMs (experimentation with different prompt templates, versioning models, evaluating responses). Lakehouse AI features like the MosaicML training and AI monitoring help with retraining models when data is updated and ensuring model outputs stay reliable. By having these capabilities in Databricks, a data team can go from raw data to a deployed AI application (like a Q&A bot or a personalized marketing model) on one platform.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Lakehouse AI elevates the Lakehouse from handling traditional BI and ML to being a prime platform for the **era of generative AI**. It does so by leveraging the Lakehouse’s strengths (unified data, governance) and adding specialized AI tooling. This means enterprises can use *one* platform to both store/manage their data and build state-of-the-art AI models with it, instead of moving data to specialized AI tools. By integrating capabilities like vector search and GPU serving, Databricks ensures that the Lakehouse can achieve low latency and high performance for AI workloads, which historically were not associated with data lake platfo ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Lakehouse%20AI%20and%20its%20unique,5%2C%20and%20more))13】. Lakehouse AI also emphasizes governance – for instance, keeping LLM fine-tuning data and resulting models under Unity Catalog governance and tracking usage – addressing the emerging need for **AI governance** alongside data governance. In summary, Lakehouse AI extends the Lakehouse’s **unification philosophy to AI workloads**: data, analytics, and now AI development all happen in one environment. This accelerates AI innovation (since teams don’t need to stitch together data pipelines and ML pipelines across different systems) and helps ensure that the move to incorporate technologies like LLMs can be done in a **secure, data-centric, and collaborative** manner on top of the Lakeho ([Lakehouse AI: Data-Centric Generative AI | Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/lakehouse-ai#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20will%20have%20a,innovations%20include%20Vector%20Search%2C%20Lakehouse))11】.

## MLflow Integration
**How it works:** MLflow is an open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle, and Databricks provides a **managed, integrated MLflow service** as part of its platform. In practice, when you use Databricks, MLflow’s tracking server and artifact storage are automatically handled for you – you don’t need to set up any infrastructure. Every Databricks workspace has an MLflow Tracking server (backed by the Unity Catalog metadata store and cloud object storage) where runs are recorded, and an MLflow Model Registry for managing model versions. This integration is seamless: for example, calling `mlflow.log_param()` or `mlflow.autolog()` in a Databricks notebook will log to the workspace’s central tracking server, and you can view results in the Databricks UI (under the Experiments sidebar). MLflow in Databricks also ties into access control; experiments and registered models can be permissioned via Unity Catalog, ensuring only authorized users can view or modify t ([MLflow Overview](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/introduction/#:~:text=MLflow%20Overview%20Databricks%20Managed%20MLflow,Catalog%2C%20Model%20Serving%2C%20and))40】. The Model Registry in Databricks MLflow allows one-click model promotion to production and even directly enabling **Databricks Model Serving** for a given model.

**Primary use cases:** MLflow integration is used for **experiment tracking** – data scientists log their hyperparameters, metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.), and any artifacts (like model binaries) for each experiment run. This provides a record so they can compare runs and choose the best model. Additionally, teams use the **MLflow Model Registry** to collaborate on models: a common workflow is training a model and then using the registry to mark it as “Staging” (for QA by another team member) and later “Production” when approved, with the registry keeping track of which code version produced the model and who approved it. Another use case is **reproducibility**: because MLflow can log the data version (Delta table version or dataset fingerprint) and the environment, later one can exactly reproduce a model’s training run. In Databricks, MLflow is also leveraged for **batch scoring jobs** (loading a model from the registry in a batch job to score a large dataset) and for **serving** (the Model Serving feature can directly serve a model from the registry with a REST endpoint). Essentially, any scenario in Databricks ML where you need to track or deploy models uses MLflow – it’s the mechanism behind the scenes for logging models from AutoML, for storing models trained in notebooks, and for deploying models to endpoints.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Having MLflow integrated provides the Lakehouse with a **systematic ML lifecycle management** capability. It brings order and governance to the potentially chaotic process of model development. Since it’s integrated with Unity Catalog, all ML artifacts (experiments, models) are governed alongside data assets, completing the Lakehouse governance story for ([MLflow Overview](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/introduction/#:~:text=MLflow%20Overview%20Databricks%20Managed%20MLflow,Catalog%2C%20Model%20Serving%2C%20and))40】. This integration means that the Lakehouse isn’t just a place to store and process data, but also a place where **models are first-class assets** – tracked, versioned, and managed through their lifecycle. Managed MLflow lowers the barrier to adoption because teams don’t need separate tools for experiment tracking; everything is in one UI. It also enables **CI/CD for models** – for example, using the MLflow REST API or Databricks CLI, you can programmatically update and deploy models as part of pipelines. By ensuring every model and experiment on Databricks is automatically tracked, the platform makes ML efforts more reproducible and accountable. In short, MLflow integration turns the Lakehouse into a **unified platform for not only data, but also models**, allowing organizations to treat models with the same rigor as they treat their data (with lineage, version control, and governan ([4 Key Features of Databricks Machine Learning](https://key2consulting.com/4-key-features-databricks-machine-learning/#:~:text=According%20to%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20official%20documentation%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%282))83】. This is essential for moving AI projects from exploration to production in a safe and efficient way.

## Delta Sharing
**How it works:** Delta Sharing is an **open protocol for secure data sharing** introduced by Databricks, and it’s implemented as a native feature in the Lakehouse. With Delta Sharing, data providers can share data (for example, a Delta Lake table or a set of Parquet files) with external parties in a read-only fashion, **without copying the data out** of their cloud stor ([Delta Sharing | Delta Lake](https://delta.io/sharing/#:~:text=An%20open%20standard%20for%20secure,data%20sharing))26】. Under the hood, when a share is created, Unity Catalog governs it – one defines a Share (a collection of tables or files) and adds recipients. Each recipient gets a secure credential (either a token or integration with cloud identity), which they can use with an open-source Delta Sharing client to query the data. When the recipient queries, they go through the Delta Sharing server (hosted by Databricks) which checks permissions and then provides pre-signed URLs to directly read the data from the provider’s storage. The data itself is still in the provider’s account (e.g., S3 or ADLS); only the necessary pieces are streamed to the recipient. The protocol is open and designed to support many clients – for example, there are connectors so that recipients can use Python (Pandas), Apache Spark, BI tools, etc., to access shared data. Importantly, Delta Sharing being an open standard means even non-Databricks platforms can implement it, fostering ecosystem interoperabil ([Delta Sharing | Delta Lake](https://delta.io/sharing/#:~:text=An%20open%20standard%20for%20secure,data%20sharing))26】.

**Primary use cases:** Delta Sharing is used whenever you need to **share data across organizational or platform boundaries**. One common use case is a company sharing a dataset with an external partner or vendor. For instance, a retailer might share point-of-sale data with a supplier so that the supplier can analyze sell-through rates. Traditionally this might require setting up FTP transfers or sending files, but with Delta Sharing the retailer can simply grant access to a table and the supplier can live query it (and always get the latest updates). Another use case is monetizing data – data providers can offer data products (like financial data, market data, etc.) via Delta Sharing to customers as a service. Because it’s secure and doesn’t require giving the entire dataset (the provider can revoke access anytime), it’s a controlled way to commercialize data. Internally, some use cases involve sharing between different cloud environments or teams. For example, if part of an organization is on Databricks and another on a different Spark platform, Delta Sharing can let them exchange data without complex pipelines. Essentially, any scenario requiring **federated sharing** – such as consortiums pooling data for research, or multi-cloud enterprises avoiding data silos – can leverage Delta Sharing. It’s worth noting that recipients can query the data *in place* (no downloading huge files), which enables near-real-time collaboration.

**Contribution to Lakehouse:** Delta Sharing extends the Lakehouse’s philosophy of unification to **inter-organizational data collaboration**. It turns the Lakehouse into a **hub for data exchange**, not just storage. By using an open protocol, it avoids locking either party into proprietary systems, aligning with Databricks’ open standards approach. For the Lakehouse owner (data provider), it means they can share data with external consumers while still maintaining it in one location (the Lakehouse), thus **eliminating multiple copies** and keeping governance centralized. Unity Catalog integrates with Delta Sharing to ensure that shared data is audited and access can be managed easily (each share and recipient is tracked). This also enhances governance – you can see exactly who accessed what data and when, which is crucial for compliance when sharing data. Moreover, Delta Sharing can democratize data within a company: different departments can become data providers/consumers in a governed way rather than sending CSV extracts over email. In sum, Delta Sharing adds an **open collaboration layer** to the Lakehouse. It reinforces the value of storing data in Delta Lake format, since those tables can be directly and securely shared out. As more organizations adopt Lakehouse architecture, Delta Sharing creates a network effect whereby data can fluidly yet securely move between Lakehouse platforms, **breaking down data silos** beyond just one company’s boundar ([Delta Sharing | Delta Lake](https://delta.io/sharing/#:~:text=An%20open%20standard%20for%20secure,data%20sharing))26】. This capability is increasingly important in a data-driven ecosystem where partnerships and data marketplaces are on the rise.
